# LinkedIn Learning

This project is my attempts to follow along with LinkedIn Learning videos. Generally I watch the video and follow along, but also make my own modifications to appeal to my tastes and ensure that I understand the concepts. Since this was a blog, I provided the content from my early posts on CaringBridge.

## Original Course

This project started with the LinkedIn Learning course React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site by Shaun Wassell.

Since the course material is two years old, some of the syntax is out-of-date, specifically with the 'react-router-dom' package. This made the process more frustrating, but perhaps a better learning experience, including reading the documentation at https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/, which is also a version behind. Additional course-specific help is available at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-MUZYkzUYVexBhLQWR1QG2ik7Jk2yxB.
The MongoDB set up was all for Mac, so needed some Windows tweaking, but not too much difficulty.
The AWS instructions were also a little dated, but nothing that impeded progress.

## Subsequent Course

Since there was an About page on the blog, I thought this would be a good place to implement the project from CSS Essentials Training by Christina Truong: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-essential-training-3. It involves making a resume-style webpage, which seemed like the About page.

## Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
