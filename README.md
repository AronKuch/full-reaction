# LinkedIn Learning

This project is following along with the LinkedIn Learning course React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site by Shaun Wassell.

Generally I watch the video and follow along, but also make my own modifications to appeal to my tastes and ensure that I understand the concepts. Since this was a blog, I provided the content from my early posts on CaringBridge.

Also, since the course material is two years old, some of the syntax is out-of-date, specifically with the 'react-router-dom' package. This made the process more frustrating, but perhaps a better learning experience, including reading the documentation at https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/, which is also a version behind. Additional course-specific help is available at https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl-MUZYkzUYVexBhLQWR1QG2ik7Jk2yxB.
