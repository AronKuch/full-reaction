# LinkedIn Learning

This project is following along with the LinkedIn Learning course React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site by Shaun Wassell.

Generally I watch the video and follow along, but also make my own modifications to appeal to my tastes and ensure that I understand the concepts.


## Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
